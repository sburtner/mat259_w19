# Proj 1 - MySQL Assignment | Knowledge Discovery

**THE CONCEPT**: In any database, there lies hidden knowledge. What does a database contain, and what can MySQL queries reveal? Your first assignment is to find something of interest based on your own cultural / knowledge interests. Here are some options: 

1) **Topics of Cultural Interest**: 
- What is the performance of a topic, a title, - a media over time, or by volume, or by trends, or by news events?
- How does the collection change over time?

2) **The Database Organizational Structure**
- What is the classification approach that the library uses
- What anomalies, errors, outliers, illogical classification methods, etc. may be revealed. 
(All databases have these as its impossible to precisely classify all things within a structured system)

3) Data Analytics Query Methods
- Explore statistical methods or algorithms to retrieve or process data

----------

## GETTING THE DATA:

- Use the MySQL Workbench to write a query by which to retrieve the data from the SPL database.
- Use the spl_2016 database which gets updated daily.

## DO THE ASSIGNMENT:

Do a report on your research, and propose what to visualize based on time, or volume of activity. Possibly make a comparison between book(s) and movie(s) and soundtracks (cd).

Once you have all the material - click on "POST REPLY" to this [link][http://w2.mat.ucsb.edu/forum/viewtopic.php?f=77&t=313] and add your info to complete the assignment.

# Map Use and Musings at the Seattle Public Library - 2016

## Research Questions relating to Organizational Structure:
### RQ1: What maps are available at the Seattle Public Libary (SPL)?

**Why am I asking this?** It would be helpful to first know what maps are available at SPL before knowing which ones are checked out and . This will be helpful for later visualizations that require normalization.


### RQ2: How many map collections does SPL have?

**Why am I asking this?** The map collections can be an indication of the *coverage* of the globe. Collections with more maps may imply increased interest in that particular area.


### RQ3: How many of these maps were left 'Uncategorized'?

**Why am I asking this?** Maps seem like they would be hard to organize. 


### RQ4: What subjects do the maps have?

### RQ5: Which regions of the world are covered by the given maps?


## Research Questions relating to Cultural Interest:
