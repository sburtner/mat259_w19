# MySQL Assignment

**THE CONCEPT**: In any database, there lies hidden knowledge. What does a database contain, and what can MySQL queries reveal? Your first assignment is to find something of interest based on your own cultural / knowledge interests. Here are some options: 

1) Topics of Cultural Interest: 
- What is the performance of a topic, a title, - a media over time, or by volume, or by trends, or by news events?
- How does the collection change over time?

2) The Database Organizational Structure
- What is the classification approach that the library uses
- What anomalies, errors, outliers, illogical classification methods, etc. may be revealed. 
(All databases have these as its impossible to precisely classify all things within a structured system)

3) Data Analytics Query Methods
- Explore statistical methods or algorithms to retrieve or process data

## DO THE ASSIGNMENT:

Do a report on your research, and propose what to visualize based on time, or volume of activity. Possibly make a comparison between book(s) and movie(s) and soundtracks (cd)

Your query may function to process the existing data, or to calculate retrieved information. To create visualizations, you will need to have 4 columns of numeric values, for instance, time-based, or ordered data (itemNumber, dewey, volume, etc.) These will be used for horizontal, vertical, depth positions, and the 4th to define color density of the positioned item.

## Ideas for Assignment 1
### How do the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards affect movie check-out?

Interesting Questions to ask:
- The Golden Globes kick off the start of the award season, while the Academy Awards (Oscars) occur towards the end. Is one more influential than the other in terms of influencing the types of movies that people check-out?
- What is the time lag like in terms of how long it takes for people to pick up on the hype of award-winning movies? How does it change during and after the award season?
- Does a film winning an award affect the book being checked-out more too?

### Other ideas
- trends on movies based on books versus not
- When do we watch scary movies (week days versus weekends)?
